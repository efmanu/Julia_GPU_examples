    "text": "A number of packages have been developed for Julia that enable developers to write code that will run on graphics processing units (GPUs). But until now, open source documentation which would enable a developer to go from zero CUDA knowledge to making effective use of these packages has not existed. This tutorial aims to change that. I will guide you through the full workflow of writing a basic program in Julia that will run on a GPU. Things you will learn from this tutorial include:What a GPU is and why writing code to run on GPUs might be useful.\nHow to set up your computer and install the graphics drivers necessary to make use of your GPU.\nHow to write Julia code that will run on a GPU in a parallel manner using threads, blocks, shared memory and streaming.\nHow to benchmark Julia code that runs on GPUs.This tutorial assumes you already know how to write code in Julia. Julia is a high level, syntactically intuitive language, so if you do not know Julia but do know other programming languages you may be able to follow along anyway. To get started coding in Julia, I recommend reading some of the Julia Documentation.This tutorial is intended to provide a foundation for developers to start writing Julia code that runs on GPUs. It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to everything you could conceivably do on a GPU using Julia. Hopefully, you will find it instead gives a gentle introduction to some core concepts in GPU programming and how you can use them in Julia. I focus on the CUDAdrv, CUDAnative and CuArrays packages in this tutorial, although other Julia packages for using GPUs exist - see the JuliaGPU github page for details."

    "text": "You have probably heard of a type of computer chip called a central processing unit (CPU). GPUs are a different type of computer chip. The major difference between CPUs and GPUs is how each chip is organised. Whereas CPUs tend to have a small number of threads, GPUs can have orders of magnitudes more. On GPUs, you can write code that parallelises across thousands of threads, something that would be impossible on CPUs without great effort and expense."

    "text": "(Image: )Each GPU contains a \'grid\' of \'blocks\'. Each block in that grid is itself composed of a matrix of \'threads\'. Programs written to run on GPUs can be parallelised over blocks or threads or both. Each block has an index representing its position in the grid, and each thread has an index representing its position within its block. When we run a function in parallel on a GPU using Julia, we can specify how many blocks and threads we want it to run on. For example, the GPU in my laptop has 65535 blocks and each block contains 1024 threads. I could use the GPU in my laptop to create a grid like the one above by telling my GPU to run a function on 16 blocks and 16 threads. If I try to run my function on more threads or blocks than my GPU has, an InexactError is thrown (somewhat cryptically) and my function fails to execute."

For example, copying data from CPUs to GPUs is a required step for most GPU software, and the copying instruction will need to execute at least partly on a CPU. Because GPU software typically executes instructions on both CPUs and GPUs, it is useful to have some terminology to describe where a particular line of code is being executed. Code that executes on CPUs is commonly described as executing \'on the host\', whilst code executing on GPUs is described as executing \'on the device\'. We can also use the terms \'host\' and \'device\' to describe where data lives in memory and operations copying data between CPUs and GPUs."

They additionally created the CUDA toolkit, which is required to compile CUDA C code. Many of the functions in CUDAnative and CUDAdrv, two of the Julia packages covered in this tutorial, are highly analogous to functions in CUDA C. These packages depend upon the CUDA toolkit or libraries from it, and rely upon the GPU they are running on having a CUDA architecture.  "

    "category": "section",
    "text": "As exciting as the example above was, the eagle eyed reader may have noticed that it does not actually run on a GPU. We can fix that.The first thing we need to do is load packages that will enable us to run Julia code on GPUs.using CuArrays, CUDAnative, CUDAdrvCuArrays is a package that allows us to easily transfer arrays from CPU to GPU. CUDAnative allows us to write relatively high level code for executing functions on GPUs. We will not explicitly call CUDAdrv in our example, but much of CUDAnative depends on CUDAdrv to work.Next, we need to identify what part of our example could benefit from being ported to GPU. Since most of the actual work is being done in add!(), this is an obvious target. Let\'s modify add!() so that it could be executed on a GPU.function add!(a,b,c)\n    local tid = 1\n    while (tid <= min(length(a), length(b), length(c)))\n        c[tid] = a[tid] + b[tid]\n        tid += 1\n    end\n    return nothing\nend\nSince add!() is now ready to run on a GPU, we have thus transformed add!() from an ordinary function to a kernel. Isn\'t terminology wonderful?Aside from now referring to add!() as a kernel rather than a function, the only thing that has changed between the CPU and GPU version of add!() is the addition of this line:return nothingCUDA requires that kernels must return nothing. Aside from meaning that we have to add this line to all of our kernels, this also means we potentially have to think a bit about how to get the results of our GPU computations out of our kernel, since we cannot directly return our results. As add!() is a function which alters its arguments, this is not actually a problem which requires much thought in our example.Let\'s see how main() has changed in the GPU version of our example.function main()\n\n    # Make three CuArrays\n    a = CuArrays.CuArray(fill(0, 10))\n    b = CuArrays.CuArray(fill(0, 10))\n    c = CuArrays.CuArray(fill(0, 10))\n\n    # Fill a and b with values\n    for i in 1:10\n        a[i] = i\n        b[i] = i * 2\n    end\n\n    # Execute the kernel\n    @cuda add!(a,b,c)\n\n    # Copy a,b and c back from the device to the host\n    a = Array(a)\n    b = Array(b)\n    c = Array(c)\n\n    # Do a sanity check\n    for i in 1:length(a)\n        @test a[i] + b[i] ≈ c[i]\n    end\nend\n\nmain()main() is looking pretty different from the CPU version of our code. Let\'s work through it step by step.function main()\n\n    # Make three CuArrays\n    a = CuArrays.CuArray(fill(0, 10))\n    b = CuArrays.CuArray(fill(0, 10))\n    c = CuArrays.CuArray(fill(0, 10))Like in the CPU version of main, we start by making three arrays. However here, instead of making three standard Julia arrays, we make three CuArrays. CuArrays are GPU compatible arrays. For reasons we will gloss over here, ordinary Julia arrays would not work in our example. Fortunately, CuArrays are a subtype of AbstractArrays and can often be treated exactly the same way as a normal AbstractArray. Many standard array operations work out of the box on CuArrays, you can find a list here. If you are curious why we cannot use a normal AbstractArray or Array here, see the upcoming chapter Challenges in Julia GPU Software Development for details.The next step of main() is virtually identical to the CPU version.# Fill a and b with values\nfor i in 1:10\n    a[i] = i\n    b[i] = i * 2\nendThe only thing to note here is that like I promised, we can treat a and b exactly like an ordinary AbstractArray here, no special syntax is required.In the next step we actually execute the kernel:# Execute the kernel\n@cuda add!(a,b,c)This looks remarkably similar to the CPU version of main at this step, especially when you consider that this line is responsible for executing add!() on a different type of computing chip. The magic is contained in the @cuda macro. @cuda is part of the CUDAnative package, and behind the scenes is responsible for transforming the add!() function into a form recognised and executed by the GPU.If you are familiar with CUDA C or C++, you might be surprised that main() does not include any step to copy a, b and c from the host (CPU) to the device (GPU). This is taken care of behind the scenes by CUDAnative and CuArrays. However, you do explicitly need to copy your CuArrays back from device (GPU) to host (CPU), which is what happens in the next step of main():# Copy a,b and c back from the device to the host\na = Array(a)\nb = Array(b)\nc = Array(c)The function responsible for copying your CuArrays from device to host is Array().Finally, we do the same sanity check as in the CPU version of main and make a function call to main():    # Do a sanity check\n    for i in 1:length(a)\n        @test a[i] + b[i] ≈ c[i]\n    end\nend\n\nmain()Note that in both versions of main(), the sanity check is carried out on the host (CPU), not the device (GPU).So we have written our first Julia script that will execute on a GPU! That is pretty cool. But again, the eagle eyed amongst you might be grumbling. Whilst our script does run on a GPU, there is absolutely no parallelism in it. In fact, it is likely that the GPU version of our script is actually slower than the CPU version, given that GPU processors are generally slower than CPU processors AND we had to copy the data from host to device and back again in the GPU version, which we did not have to bother with in the CPU version. Time to introduce some parallelism to our script."

That is it. However, let\'s think about what this will actually do. Running our current version of add!() over 10 threads simply amounts to running add!() 10 times simultaneously. Obviously, this will not be any faster than running add!() once.Let\'s modify add!() so we can make a more productive use of the 10 threads.function add!(a,b,c)\n    tid = threadIdx().x\n    if (tid <= min(length(a), length(b), length(c)))\n        c[tid] = a[tid] + b[tid]\n    end\n    return nothing\nendAgain, we have only changed one line:tid = threadIdx().xthreadIdx() is a function from CUDAnative which returns the three dimensional index of the thread that this particular instance of the kernel is running on. Here, we use threadIdx().x to get the x coordinate for the thread the kernel is running on. As we specified in our call to @cuda that we would use 10 threads, the value of threadIdx().x will be between 1 and 10 for each instance of the kernel. Therefore, when we call@cuda threads=10 add!(a,b,c)We spawn 10 threads and on each thread one element of c is calculated. Clearly this will be a lot faster than calculating all 10 elements sequentially."

    "text": "Following our example of vector addition in the previous section, you may be left wondering what the point of making a distinction between blocks and threads is. This section should make this clear.You may recall from \"Some Background on GPUs\" that GPUs are composed of grids of blocks, where each block contains threads. In the drawing below, we have deployed a grid of 16 blocks each containing 16 threads (@cuda threads = 16, blocks = 16).(Image: )In addition to threads, each block contains \'shared memory\'. Shared memory is memory which can be read and written to by all the threads in a given block. Shared memory can\'t be accessed by threads not in the specified block. This is illustrated in the diagram below.(Image: )In the code we wrote for vector addition, we did not use shared memory. Instead we used global memory. Global memory can be accessed from all threads, regardless of what block they live in, but has the disadvantage of taking a lot longer to read from compared with shared memory. There are two main reasons we might use shared memory in a program:It can be useful to have threads which can \'communicate\' with each other via shared memory.\nIf we have a kernel that frequently has to read from memory, it might be quicker to have it read from shared rather than global memory (but this very much depends on your particular algorithm).Of course, there is an obvious potential disadvantage to using shared memory. Giving multiple threads the capability to read and write from the same memory is potentially powerful. However it is also potentially dangerous. Now it is possible for threads to try to write to the same location in memory simultaneously. If we want there to be a dependency between threads, where thread A reads the results written by thread B, there is no automatic guarantee that thread A will not try to read the results before thread B has written them. We need a method to synchronise threads so this type of situation can be avoided. Fortunately, such a method exists as part of CUDAnative."

It is a lot to take in, but don\'t worry, we will go through it step by step.function dot(a,b,c, N, threadsPerBlock, blocksPerGrid)\n\n    # Set up shared memory cache for this current block.\n    cache = @cuDynamicSharedMem(Int64, threadsPerBlock)\n\n    # Initialise some variables.\n    tid = (threadIdx().x - 1) + (blockIdx().x - 1) * blockDim().x\n    totalThreads = blockDim().x * gridDim().x\n    cacheIndex = threadIdx().x - 1\n    temp = 0\n\n    # Iterate over vector to do dot product in parallel way\n    while tid < N\n        temp += a[tid + 1] * b[tid + 1]\n        tid += totalThreads\n    end\n\n    # set cache values\n    cache[cacheIndex + 1] = temp\n\n    # synchronise threads\n    sync_threads()\n\n    # In the step below, we add up all of the values stored in the cache\n    i::Int = blockDim().x ÷ 2\n    while i!=0\n        if cacheIndex < i\n            cache[cacheIndex + 1] += cache[cacheIndex + i + 1]\n        end\n        sync_threads()\n        i = i ÷ 2\n    end\n\n    # cache[1] now contains the sum of vector dot product calculations done in\n    # this block, so we write it to c\n    if cacheIndex == 0\n        c[blockIdx().x] = cache[1]\n    end\n\n    return nothing\nendThis is more complicated than the vector addition kernel, so let\'s work through it bit by bit. First of all, it is important to keep in mind that dot() (the kernel) is intended to be called across multiple blocks AND threads. Below is the line in main() in which the kernel is called:@cuda blocks = blocksPerGrid threads = threadsPerBlock shmem =\n(threadsPerBlock * sizeof(Int64)) dot(a,b,c, N, threadsPerBlock, blocksPerGrid)Note that we specify both a number of blocks (blocksPerGrid) and a number of threads (threadsPerBlock) on which the kernel will be executed. This means dot() will be executed on threadsPerBlock number of threads in blocksPerGrid number of blocks. For example, if threadsPerBlock = 10 and blocksPerGrid = 10, we would deploy 10 blocks each containing 10 threads and execute the dot() on each of those threads, meaning dot() would be executed 100 times in parallel. We also specify a value for a flag called shmem for the first time. shmem specifies the amount of shared memory that needs to be allocated in each block for dot(), and will be discussed in more detail later in this section.Before we start dissecting the kernel line by line, it would be useful to get a brief overview of what it is doing. On each thread executing the kernel, the kernel begins by calculating the product of a subset of the elements in a and b and storing the results in an array in shared memory. In the second part of the kernel, the values in the array are summed. However, we should not get ahead of ourselves, so we will start dissecting this function by focusing on the lines below:function dot(a,b,c, N, threadsPerBlock, blocksPerGrid)\n\n    # Set up shared memory cache for this current block.\n    cache = @cuDynamicSharedMem(Int64, threadsPerBlock)Here, we are setting a variable called cache to the output of a function call to @cuDynamicSharedMem. As the comment suggests, this is required to create a cache of shared memory that can be accessed by all the threads in the current block. @cuDynamicSharedMem is a function from CUDAnative which allocates an array in dynamic shared memory on the GPU. The first argument specifies the type of elements in the array and the second argument specifies the dimensions of the array. Socache = @cuDynamicSharedMem(Int64, threadsPerBlock)allocates an array in shared memory with the dimensions threadsPerBlock, where each element in the array is of type Int64.So now we have an array of size threadsPerBlock in shared memory which we can fill with Int64s. Next we set the value of the thread index (tid):# Initialise some variables.\ntid = (threadIdx().x - 1) + (blockIdx().x - 1) * blockDim().xThis is the first time we have mixed up thread and block indexes in the same kernel! So what is going on?The aim of this line of code is to generate a unique thread index for each thread. threadIdx().x gives the index for the current thread inside the current block. So threadIdx().x is not sufficient by itself because we are launching the kernel over multiple blocks. Each block has a thread with the index 1 (so threadIdx().x = 1), a second thread with the index 2 (threadIdx().x = 2) and so on, so we need a different approach to generate a unique thread index. blockDim().x gives number of threads in a block, which is the same for each block in a GPU. By multiplying the block index minus one (blockIdx().x - 1) and the number of threads in a block (blockDim().x), we obtain the total number of threads in all blocks before the one we are currently in. Then we add the thread index (threadIdx().x) in the current block to this total, thus generating a unique thread index for each thread across all blocks. This approach is illustrated below.(Image: )A final thing to note is that we subtract one from threadIdx().x and blockIdx().x. This is because Julia is tragically a one indexed programming language. You will notice a lot of plus and minus ones in this example, they are all there for this reason and whilst you are getting your head around the core concepts you should do you best to ignore them.Fortunately the next three lines are conceptually a lot simpler:cacheIndex = threadIdx().x - 1\ntotalThreads = blockDim().x * gridDim().x\ntemp = 0cacheIndex is the index we will use to write an element to the array of shared memory we created. Remember shared memory is only accessible within the current block, so we do not need to worry about making a unique index across blocks like we did for tid. We set it to threadIdx().x - 1 so that each thread is writing to a separate location in shared memory - otherwise threads could overwrite the results calculated by other threads. totalThreads is the product of the number of threads in each block (blockDim().x) and the number of blocks in the grid (gridDim().x). This is equal to the total number of threads we have deployed using @cuda.Now we are ready to start calculating the dot product:# Iterate over vector to do dot product in parallel way\nwhile tid < N\n    temp += a[tid + 1] * b[tid + 1]\n    tid += totalThreads\nendFor context, N is the number of elements in a (which is the same as the number of elements in b). So while tid is less than the number of elements in a, we increment the value of temp by the product of a[tid + 1] and b[tid + 1] - this is the core operation in a vector dot product. Then, we increment tid by the total number of threads deployed on the GPU. This line enables us to carry out dot products for vectors which have more elements than the total number of threads on our GPU (ie. if N > totalThreads).After exiting the while loop, we write the value calculated in temp to shared memory:# set cache values\ncache[cacheIndex + 1] = tempIn the next step of the kernel, we want to sum up all the values stored in shared memory. We do this by finding the sum of all the elements in cache. But remember that each thread is running asynchronously - just because one thread has finished executing the line:cache[cacheIndex + 1] = tempDoes not mean that all threads have executed that line. To avoid trying to sum the elements of cache before they have all been written, we need to make the threads all pause and wait until every thread has reached the same line in the kernel. Fortunately, such a function exists as part of CUDAnative:# synchronise threads\nsync_threads()When each thread reaches this line, it pauses in its execution of the kernel until all of the threads in that block have reached the same place. Then, the threads restart again.Now all the threads have written to shared memory, we are ready to sum the elements of cache:# In the step below, we add up all of the values stored in the cache\ni::Int = blockDim().x ÷ 2\nwhile i!=0\n    if cacheIndex < i\n        cache[cacheIndex + 1] += cache[cacheIndex + i + 1]\n    end\n    sync_threads()\n    i = i ÷ 2\nendHere, we initialise i as half of the total number of threads in a block. In the first iteration of the while loop, if cacheIndex is less than this number, we add the value stored at cache[cacheIndex + i + 1] to the value of cache[cacheIndex + 1]. Then we synchronise the threads again, divide i by two and enter the second while loop iteration. If you work through this conceptually, you should see that provided the number of threads in a block is an even number, eventually the value at cache[1] will be equal to the sum of all the elements in cache.Now we need to write the value of cache[1] to c (remember that we can not directly return the value of cache[1] due to the requirement that the kernel must always return nothing).# cache[1] now contains the sum of vector dot product calculations done in\n# this block, so we write it to c\nif cacheIndex == 0\n    c[blockIdx().x] = cache[1]\nend\n\nreturn nothing\nendAnd that is it! We have made it through the kernel. Now all we have to do is run the kernel on a GPU:function main()\n\n    # Initialise variables\n    N::Int64 = 33 * 1024\n    threadsPerBlock::Int64 = 256\n    blocksPerGrid::Int64 = min(32, (N + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock)\n\n    # Create a,b and c\n    a = CuArrays.CuArray(fill(0, N))\n    b = CuArrays.CuArray(fill(0, N))\n    c = CuArrays.CuArray(fill(0, blocksPerGrid))\n\n    # Fill a and b\n    for i in 1:N\n        a[i] = i\n        b[i] = 2*i\n    end\n\n    # Execute the kernel. Note the shmem argument - this is necessary to allocate\n    # space for the cache we allocate on the gpu with @cuDynamicSharedMem\n    @cuda blocks = blocksPerGrid threads = threadsPerBlock shmem =\n    (threadsPerBlock * sizeof(Int64)) dot(a,b,c, N, threadsPerBlock, blocksPerGrid)\n\n    # Copy c back from the gpu (device) to the host\n    c = Array(c)\n\n    local result = 0\n\n    # Sum the values in c\n    for i in 1:blocksPerGrid\n        result += c[i]\n    end\n\n    # Check whether output is correct\n    println(\"Does GPU value \", result, \" = \", 2 * sum_squares(N - 1))\nend\n\nmain()\nmain() starts by initialising several variables, including N which sets the size of a, b and c. We also initialise the number of threads we want the GPU to use per block and the number of blocks we want to use on the GPU. Next, we use CuArrays to create a, b and c and to fill a and b. Then, we use @cuda to execute the kernel on the GPU:@cuda blocks = blocksPerGrid threads = threadsPerBlock shmem =\n(threadsPerBlock * sizeof(Int64)) dot(a,b,c, N, threadsPerBlock, blocksPerGrid)Note that in addition to setting the number of blocks and threads we want the GPU to use, we set a value for shmem. shmem describes the amount of dynamic shared memory we need to allocate for the kernel - see below for more details. Since we use @cuDynamicSharedMem to make an array of size threadsPerBlock full of Int64s in the kernel, we need to allocate (threadsPerBlock * sizeof(Int64) bytes of space in advance when we call @cuda.After executing the kernel on GPU, we copy c back to the host (CPU). At this point, c is an array whose length equals the number of blocks in the grid. Each element in c is equal to the sum of the values calculated by the threads in a block. We need to sum the values of c to find the final result of the vector dot product:# Sum the values in c\nfor i in 1:blocksPerGrid\n    result += c[i]\nendFinally, we do a sanity check to make sure the output is correct. For completeness, this is the function sum_squares():function sum_squares(x)\n    return (x * (x + 1) * (2 * x + 1) / 6)\nendAnd that is it! We now have a complete Julia script which calculates a vector dot product on a GPU, making use of shared memory and synchronisation. In the next section, we will discuss streaming."

Like @cuDynamicSharedMem, @cuStaticSharedMem allocates arrays in shared memory. However unlike @cuDynamicSharedMem, @cuStaticSharedMem allocates arrays statically rather than dynamically. Memory that is statically allocated is allocated at compilation time, whereas memory that is dynamically allocated is allocated at program execution. We used @cuDynamicSharedMem in our example because one of the command line arguments for @cuDynamicSharedMem was a kernel command line argument (threadsPerBlock). Because the value of the kernel command line argument is not known at compilation time, dynamic rather than static memory allocation was required.A consequence of using dynamic rather than static memory allocation was that we had to specify how much memory @cuDynamicSharedMem would need in our @cuda call. Otherwise, there is no way @cuda could know the correct amount of shared memory to allocate in advance, since @cuDynamicSharedMem does not determine how much shared memory it will need until it runs."

    "text": "In CUDA, a stream is a sequence of operations executed in order on a device. Streams are nifty since they allow us to execute operations in parallel. An important feature is that streams do not have to carry out the same operations, so you can for example have one stream copying data and another running the analysis. Often copying data between the host and the device is one of the slowest steps in a GPU program. By writing your program with streams, you can speed up execution by splitting your data into chunks and have the GPU analysing a chunk in one stream whilst simultaneously copying a chunk of data to the GPU in another stream.It should be noted that Julia\'s support for streaming in GPU programming is still rudimentary. As you will see, it is easy to stream kernel execution (analysis), but the ideal of streaming both data transfer and analysis is more challenging. Streaming both data transfer and analysis will require us to write much lower level code than is usually seen in Julia. Let\'s start with the simpler task of streaming our analysis."

    "text": "In this example, we return to our favourite problem of vector addition. A script which will carry out vector addition in two streams is shown below:using CuArrays, CUDAnative, CUDAdrv\nusing Test\n\n# Kernel\nfunction add!(a,b,c, index)\n    c[index] = a[index] + b[index]\n    return nothing\nend\n\nfunction main()\n\n    # Initialise a, b and c\n    a = CuArrays.CuArray(fill(0, 10))\n    b = CuArrays.CuArray(fill(0, 10))\n    c = CuArrays.CuArray(fill(0, 10))\n\n    # Put values in a and b\n    for i in 1:10\n        a[i] = i\n        b[i] = i * 2\n    end\n\n    # Create two streams\n    s1 = CuStream()\n    s2 = CuStream()\n\n    # Call add! asynchronously in two streams\n    for i in 1:2:min(length(a), length(b), length(c))\n        @cuda threads = 1 stream = s1 add!(a,b,c, i)\n        @cuda threads = 1 stream = s2 add!(a,b,c, i+1)\n    end\n\n    # Copy arrays back to host (CPU)\n    a=Array(a)\n    b=Array(b)\n    c=Array(c)\n\n    # Check the addition worked\n    for i in 1:length(a)\n        @test a[i] + b[i] ≈ c[i]\n    end\n\nend\n\nmain()So what have we changed to introduce streaming to the classic vector addition example? Firstly, the kernel is slightly different:# Kernel\nfunction add!(a,b,c, index)\n    c[index] = a[index] + b[index]\n    return nothing\nendWe now pass the index into the vectors as an argument, rather than relying on the thread or block index.As previously, main() begins by creating a, b and c and putting values in a and b. The next change is halfway through main(), where we create two streams:# Create two streams\ns1 = CuStream()\ns2 = CuStream()This is fairly self explanatory - CuStream() is a function from CUDAnative which creates a stream. Next, we use the two streams to execute the kernel simultaneously in multiple streams:# Call add! asynchronously in two streams\nfor i in 1:2:min(length(a), length(b), length(c))\n    @cuda threads = 1 stream = s1 add!(a,b,c, i)\n    @cuda threads = 1 stream = s2 add!(a,b,c, i + 1)\nendLet\'s walk through what this for loop is doing. This for loop iterates over the length of the vectors in steps of size 2. In each iteration, we execute the kernel once in the first stream (s1) using i as an index for vector addition, and once in the second stream (s2) using i + 1 as the index for vector addition. Thus, in each interation of the for loop the values of c[i] and c[i + 1] are calculated in seperate streams. main() then finishes as before by copying a, b and c back to the host and checking that the results of the calculation are correct.Hopefully you agree that executing the kernel across two streams was extremely easy in this example. However, it was also fairly pointless. We basically wrote some extra code to execute add!() on two elements of c at a time, whereas our previous example without streaming calculated every element of c in parallel using threads.Streaming can really come in to its own when used to stagger data transfer and analysis between streams. This is possible in Julia for GPU applications, but comes with a health warning..."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "To stagger data transfer and analysis between streams, we will not be able to use CUDAnative or CUarrays. This is because CuArrays.CuArray(), the function we have used to copy data from host to device up to now, executes synchronously. This means that the function does not return until the data transfer is complete. If we try to stream data transfer with a synchronous data transfer function, we will not acheive any speed up because no other streams can receive and start executing any further instructions until the current stream\'s data transfer is complete and the function has returned.To acheive speed-up by streaming data transfer, the process of data transfer must be asynchronous. If our data transfer function is asynchronous, it can return before finishing data transfer and we can submit other instructions to other streams whilst data transfer is still ongoing in the first stream. This can be a powerful way to speed up programs. It can also be useful if our data is too large to load on to the GPU all at once, as now we can upload and analyse our data in chunks whilst minimising the time the GPU spends sitting idle waiting for data to finish copying.Unlike CuArrays and CUDAnative, CUDAdrv provides support for asynchronous data transfer. The code in the next example is very analogous to CUDA C or C++ code and the example below does in fact include a (very short) CUDA C script. In practice, this means we will have to think about memory management more than previously and our code will be less pretty. If you have never written code in a lower level language like C, you may struggle to follow the next section. If you are struggling, do not panic and just move on to the next section. In practice, you can often speed up your code a lot by porting to GPU without using streams."

Starting from the beginning:using CUDAdrv, Test\n\n# \'Turn on\' device\ndev = CuDevice(0)\nctx = CuContext(dev)The script starts as usual by loading some Julia packages. Then there are two lines we have not seen before calling CuDevice and CuContext. These two lines essentially work together to create a context on the GPU. A GPU context can be thought of as analogous to a CPU process, so by running these two lines we are creating an address space and allocated resources on the GPU where our kernel can run and where we can copy data. Once we have finished working on the GPU, we will need to destroy our context so the system can clean up the resources allocated there. Both creating the context and destroying it are taken care of behind the scenes by CUDAnative, which is why we have been able to ignore these functions until now.The lines of code that follow context creation will either delight or alarm you, depending on your relationship with C:# Read in C code\nmd = CuModuleFile(joinpath(@__DIR__, \"vadd.ptx\"))\nvadd = CuFunction(md, \"kernel_vadd\")So what is going on here? Well, first CuModuleFile reads in a file called vadd.ptx. In the next line, we use CuFunction to make a handle to a function called kernel_vadd defined in vadd.ptx, then assign that function handle to vadd. The outcome of these two lines is that a function called kernel_vadd defined in vadd.ptx becomes callable in Julia, and can be called using vadd().So what do the contents of vadd.ptx look like?//\n// Generated by NVIDIA NVVM Compiler\n//\n// Compiler Build ID: CL-23083092\n// Cuda compilation tools, release 9.1, V9.1.85\n// Based on LLVM 3.4svn\n//\n\n.version 6.1\n.target sm_30\n.address_size 64\n\n	// .globl	kernel_vadd\n\n.visible .entry kernel_vadd(\n	.param .u64 kernel_vadd_param_0,\n	.param .u64 kernel_vadd_param_1,\n	.param .u64 kernel_vadd_param_2\n)\n{\n	.reg .f32 	%f<4>;\n	.reg .b32 	%r<5>;\n	.reg .b64 	%rd<11>;\n\n\n	ld.param.u64 	%rd1, [kernel_vadd_param_0];\n	ld.param.u64 	%rd2, [kernel_vadd_param_1];\n	ld.param.u64 	%rd3, [kernel_vadd_param_2];\n	cvta.to.global.u64 	%rd4, %rd3;\n	cvta.to.global.u64 	%rd5, %rd2;\n	cvta.to.global.u64 	%rd6, %rd1;\n	mov.u32 	%r1, %ctaid.x;\n	mov.u32 	%r2, %ntid.x;\n	mov.u32 	%r3, %tid.x;\n	mad.lo.s32 	%r4, %r2, %r1, %r3;\n	mul.wide.s32 	%rd7, %r4, 4;\n	add.s64 	%rd8, %rd6, %rd7;\n	ld.global.f32 	%f1, [%rd8];\n	add.s64 	%rd9, %rd5, %rd7;\n	ld.global.f32 	%f2, [%rd9];\n	add.f32 	%f3, %f1, %f2;\n	add.s64 	%rd10, %rd4, %rd7;\n	st.global.f32 	[%rd10], %f3;\n	ret;\n}Above are the contents of vadd.ptx - unless you are an assembly code expert I suspect you will agree this is not very informative. PTX stands for Parallel Thread eXecution and we will briefly discuss two ways to make PTX code in this tutorial. The first way to make PTX code is by compiling CUDA C code. So what did the CUDA C code that made this PTX file look like?extern \"C\" {\n\n__global__ void kernel_vadd(const float *a, const float *b, float *c)\n{\n    int i = blockIdx.x *blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;\n    c[i] = a[i] + b[i];\n}\n\n}Even if you do not know C, hopefully you will be able to see that this function calculates a unique thread index (i) based on the block the thread is in and the thread\'s index within that block, then adds the values of a and b at that index and stores them in c. This is very similar to many of the kernels we have written before. We can make PTX code from CUDA C scripts by executing the following command in a terminalnvcc --ptx /path/to/cuda_C_file.cuIt is also possible to make PTX code from Julia code using functions in CUDAnative such as code_ptx() - see here for details.Ok, so the outcome of all of the above is that we can now have a GPU compatible function called vadd which we can call from a Julia script to perform vector addition. Next, we create our data:# Make data\ndims = 100\na = round.(rand(Float32, dims) * 100)\nb = round.(rand(Float32, dims) * 100)\nc = similar(a)This is done on a CPU and there is nothing really to note except that we are not using CuArrays. Next, we need to allocate memory on the GPU for a, b and c:# Allocate memory for a and b on device stream 1\nbuf_a1 = Mem.alloc(sizeof(Float32))\nbuf_b1 = Mem.alloc(sizeof(Float32))Again, this is the first time we have had to do this because previously it was taken care of for us by CUDAnative. In our streaming strategy, we are going to copy one element of a and b to the device in each stream, calculate their sum and store that result in c on the device, then copy the value of c back to the host. This means we need to allocate space for one element of a, b and c for each stream. There are two streams, so in practice this means we need to allocate space twice. In the code above, we are allocating space for one element of a and one element of b for the first stream. Each element in a and b is a Float32, so we use sizeof() to work out how many bytes we need to allocate. We also need to allocate space for a and b in the other stream, so we write:# Allocate memory for a and b on device stream 2\nbuf_a2 = Mem.alloc(sizeof(Float32))\nbuf_b2 = Mem.alloc(sizeof(Float32))Next, we allocate space for c in both streams and create the streams:# Allocate memory for c on device\nd_c1 = Mem.alloc(sizeof(Float32))\nd_c2 = Mem.alloc(sizeof(Float32))\n\n# Make streams\ns1 = CuStream()\ns2 = CuStream()Now we are ready to actually start streaming data transfer and analysis. Like in the \'analysis only\' streaming example, we do this here by iterating over our arrays in increments of size 2.# Iterate over arrays in increments of 2\nfor i in 1:2:dims\n\n    # Asynchronously copy a[i] and a[i+1] onto device\n    Mem.upload!(buf_a1, Ref(a, i), sizeof(Float32), s1, async = true)\n    Mem.upload!(buf_a2, Ref(a, i+1), sizeof(Float32), s2, async = true)\n\n    # Asynchronously copy b[i] and b[i+1] onto device\n    Mem.upload!(buf_b1, Ref(b, i), sizeof(Float32), s1, async = true)\n    Mem.upload!(buf_b2, Ref(b, i+1), sizeof(Float32), s2, async = true)\n\n    # Call vadd to run on gpu\n    cudacall(vadd, (Ptr{Cfloat},Ptr{Cfloat},Ptr{Cfloat}), buf_a1, buf_b1, d_c1,\n    threads = 1, stream = s1)\n    cudacall(vadd, (Ptr{Cfloat},Ptr{Cfloat},Ptr{Cfloat}), buf_a2, buf_b2, d_c2,\n    threads = 1, stream = s2)\n\n    # Asynchronously copy c[i] and c[i+1] back to host\n    Mem.download!(Ref(c, i), d_c1, sizeof(Float32), s1, async = true)\n    Mem.download!(Ref(c, i+1), d_c2, sizeof(Float32), s2, async = true)\n\n\nendAs before, we operate on the ith element in one stream and the i + 1th element in the other stream. In each stream, the order of operations is to copy (Mem.upload!) the value of the ith or i + 1th element of a and b from the host to the pre-allocated space on the device. Then we run the kernel (using cudacall) and copy the result back to the host (Mem.download!).There are several things worth noting here. First, we must explicitly specify async = true to Mem.upload! and Mem.download! if we want them to execute asynchronously - as a default these functions are synchronous. Second, note that we call the kernel using cudacall rather than @cuda - this is because @cuda is part of CUDAnative which does not support asynchronous data transfers. Thirdly, note that we must specify which stream we are using for each of these functions - otherwise all of these functions will execute on the same stream as a default.Finally, we finish our script by checking the results of our calculation and destroying the device context:# Check it worked\n@test a+b ≈ c\n\n# Destroy context\ndestroy!(ctx)This example demonstrates that it is possible to stream data transfer and analysis in Julia. However, it should be noted that the code we wrote was so low level that almost every line we wrote was directly analogous to a CUDA C command. I would agree that the benefit of writing a program such as this in Julia versus C is debateable. There might be situations where it makes sense to write this type of program in Julia (for example, if you already had a huge Julia code base, a small part of which you wanted to port to GPU), but often it might actually be easier to use C.In the next section, we will consider some Julia specific aspects of writing GPU compatible software."

    "text": "Julia makes a distinction between bits values and heap allocated boxed values. Bits values are stored inline in memory, whereas boxed values contain pointers to objects allocated elsewhere. @cuda only supports the passing of bits values as kernel arguments. This is because bits values are of a fixed, determinate size, so @cuda is able to allocate the correct amount of memory for these values on the device. In contrast, @cuda cannot determine the size of a value with pointers, and so @cuda will throw an error. You can determine whether your values are bits values using the function isbits(), which will return true if your value is bits and false otherwise. Something to be aware of is that strings are not bits values – if you want to work with strings on GPUs you will need to convert your string to an array of chars."

    "text": "When developing GPU software, you will inevitably write kernels with bugs in them. If a bug in your kernel causes the kernel to exit and return an error message, you will often see error messages such as:ERROR: LLVM IR generated for Kernel(CuDeviceArray{Int64,1,CUDAnative.AS.Global}) is not GPU compatibleThis error message broadly means that you tried to do something which could not compile to GPU code. Common reasons this might happen include:You tried to use a Julia feature which is not supported by CUDAnative (see below).\nYour kernel contains unexpected dynamic behavior.\nYour kernel contains type instabilities.OrKernelError: kernel returns a value of type `Union{Nothing, Int64}`\nThe second error message indicates that your code compiled successfully (unless it is preceded by the first error message, or another compilation error) but that something went wrong during runtime, hence it returned something instead of nothing.Unfortunately, you will never see the sort of error message you are probably accustomed to in Julia, where a description of why the code failed to compile or run and a line number is provided. A description of why this is and macros you can use to help debug can be found here. In practice, I often debug the good old fashioned way by iteratively commenting out half of the remaining lines of code in my kernel to identify which line(s) are causing problems."

The following command can be used to call nvprof to profile a specific Julia GPU program from the command line:$ nvprof --profile-from-start off /path/to/julia /path/to/julia/scriptNote that we use --profile-from-start off to tell nvprof not to start profiling until we tell it to. There are several reasons we might not want to have nvprof start profiling straight away. One reason is that Julia is a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiled language. We often do not want to include the time taken to compile our scripts in our profiling estimates. Another reason is that GPU software usually executes some commands on CPU as well as GPU, and we may only want to profile commands executed on GPU. Finally, we might only be interested in a particular bit of our script, such as the kernel or the time taken to copy data from host to device. We can turn --profile-from-start off to enable us to profile just the bit we are interested in."

    "text": "Let\'s use our vector addition kernel streaming example to investigate how we can use nvprof for profiling. We have modified the example so it can be profiled with nvprof:using CuArrays, CUDAnative, CUDAdrv\nusing Test\n\n# Kernel\nfunction add!(a,b,c, index)\n    c[index] = a[index] + b[index]\n    return nothing\nend\n\nfunction main()\n\n    # Initialise a, b and c\n    a = CuArrays.CuArray(fill(0, 10))\n    b = CuArrays.CuArray(fill(0, 10))\n    c = CuArrays.CuArray(fill(0, 10))\n\n    # Put values in a and b\n    for i in 1:10\n        a[i] = i\n        b[i] = i * 2\n    end\n\n    # Create two streams\n    s1 = CuStream()\n    s2 = CuStream()\n\n    # Call add! asynchronously in two streams\n    for i in 1:2:min(length(a), length(b), length(c))\n        @cuda threads = 1 stream = s1 add!(a,b,c, i)\n        @cuda threads = 1 stream = s2 add!(a,b,c, i+1)\n    end\n\n    # Copy arrays back to host (CPU)\n    a=Array(a)\n    b=Array(b)\n    c=Array(c)\n\n    # Check the addition worked\n    for i in 1:length(a)\n        @test a[i] + b[i] ≈ c[i]\n    end\n\nend\n\nmain()\nCUDAdrv.@profile main()The only change we have made to this example is to add this line at the end:CUDAdrv.@profile main()This line executes main() whilst activating the CUDA profiler. This signals to nvprof the point at which to start profiling. Notice that we have already called main() once in the line before we call CUDAdrv.@profile - this is to force main() to compile before we start profiling. If we do not call the function we want to profile once before we start profiling then our profiling estimates will include the time spent compiling.Having modified our example script to invoke the nvprof profiler, we can now get profiling information by executing the following on the command line:$ nvprof --profile-from-start off julia gpu_vector_sums_streams.jlWhere gpu_vector_sums_streams.jl is the name of our example script. The output of this command should look something like this:Type  Time(%)      Time     Calls       Avg       Min       Max  Name\nGPU activities:   50.18%  21.632us        23     940ns     928ns  1.2160us  [CUDA memcpy HtoD]\n       39.64%  17.088us        10  1.7080us  1.5680us  2.1440us  ptxcall_add__1\n       10.17%  4.3850us         3  1.4610us  1.3440us  1.5680us  [CUDA memcpy DtoH]\nAPI calls:   82.95%  1.5925ms        10  159.25us  5.0680us  1.5383ms  cuLaunchKernel\n       10.24%  196.67us        23  8.5500us  6.6030us  26.618us  cuMemcpyHtoD\n        2.34%  44.868us         3  14.956us  8.3740us  26.289us  cuMemAlloc\n        2.25%  43.195us         3  14.398us  12.429us  17.862us  cuMemcpyDtoH\n        1.70%  32.641us         2  16.320us  8.3680us  24.273us  cuStreamCreate\n        0.39%  7.4110us        15     494ns     426ns     672ns  cuCtxGetCurrent\n        0.13%  2.4880us         1  2.4880us  2.4880us  2.4880us  cuDeviceGetCountThere is some pretty interesting information in this output - for example, the first line of the output tells us that 50.18% of GPU time is spent copying data from host to device.

There are two things to notice here:The Grid Size and Block Size are both (1 1 1), indicating that the kernel is executing sequentially. If you look back at the example script you will see that this is as expected - we always call the kernel on 1 thread and 1 block (the default number of threads and blocks). If you specified more threads or blocks to @cuda these fields would change.\nThe first line executes in stream 16 and the second executes in stream 17. Again, if you look back at the example script this is as expected - we create two streams then execute our kernel alternately in each stream.Finally, there are some lines copying data back from device to host:Start  Duration            Grid Size      Block Size     Regs*    SSMem*    DSMem*      Size  Throughput  SrcMemType  DstMemType           Device   Context    Stream  Name\n15.2010s  1.1840us                    -               -         -         -         -       80B  64.437MB/s      Device    Pageable  Quadro M1000M (         1         7  [CUDA memcpy DtoH]This data transfer takes place in stream 7 again."

Let\'s imagine that we decided we were not interested in profiling data transfer and just wanted to profile the kernel. We could modify our example script so it looked like below:using CuArrays, CUDAnative, CUDAdrv\nusing Test\n\n# Kernel\nfunction add!(a,b,c, index)\n    c[index] = a[index] + b[index]\n    return nothing\nend\n\nfunction main()\n\n    # Initialise a, b and c\n    a = CuArrays.CuArray(fill(0, 10))\n    b = CuArrays.CuArray(fill(0, 10))\n    c = CuArrays.CuArray(fill(0, 10))\n\n    # Put values in a and b\n    for i in 1:10\n        a[i] = -i\n        b[i] = i * i\n    end\n\n    # Create two streams\n    s1 = CuStream()\n    s2 = CuStream()\n\n    # Call add! asynchronously in two streams\n    for i in 1:2:min(length(a), length(b), length(c))\n        @cuda threads = 1 stream = s1 add!(a,b,c, i)\n        CUDAdrv.@profile @cuda threads = 1 stream = s1 add!(a,b,c, i)\n        @cuda threads = 1 stream = s2 add!(a,b,c, i+1)\n    end\n\n    # Copy arrays back to host (CPU)\n    a=Array(a)\n    b=Array(b)\n    c=Array(c)\n\n    # Check the addition worked\n    for i in 1:length(a)\n        @test a[i] + b[i] ≈ c[i]\n    end\n\nend\n\nmain()Notice that we no longer use CUDAdrv.@profile to profile main(), but we now use it to profile our call to @cuda threads = 1 stream = s1 add!(a,b,c, i).

Notice that we see 5 lines of output here, corresponding to 5 calls of the kernel, and that the kernel is always called in the same stream, because we only profiled calls to the kernel in stream s1.This section has shown some of the methods you can use to profile GPU software that you write in Julia. In the next section, we will discuss warps and branching and their impact on performance."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "Based on your reading of this tutorial so far, you could be forgiven for thinking that all threads execute entirely independently of each other. In fact, this is not the case. In CUDA architecture, threads are split into groups of 32. Each group of 32 threads executes in \'lockstep\' with each other and they are referred to as a warp. In other words, within a warp each thread is executing the same line of your program but with different data. Warps can have some important performance implications. For example, consider the pseudocode if/else statement below:if condition1\n  do thing1\nelse\n  do thing2\nendBecause all of the threads in a warp execute in lockstep, if condition1 is only true for even just one thread in the warp, all of the threads in that warp must wait until that thread has executed do thing1. Then, the thread for which condition1 was true for must wait for all of the other threads to execute the else condition and do thing2. Finally, all the threads can move on to the next line of code beyond the if/else statement.This if/else statement is an example of \'branching\' code and contains two branches - a branch corresponding to thing1 and a branch for thing2.This example illustrates the risk that branching can substantially slow down your code, as all of the threads in our warp had to wait for execution of both branches to complete. This is in contrast to CPU threads, where each thread would only have to execute the branch corresponding to whether condition1 was true or false for that thread. The take home message from this section is that you should avoid heavily branching GPU code where possible, as it is possible each warp will have to wait for every branch to be executed, dramatically slowing down your program."
