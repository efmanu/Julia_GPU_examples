I am a PhD student studying bioinformatics (computational biology) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk) and the [Wellcome Sanger Institute](https://www.sanger.ac.uk). I am supervised by Professor Anne Ferguson-Smith and Dr Martin Hemberg. I got interested in GPU software development because of its potential to accelerate bioinformatics software. I hope you enjoyed reading this tutorial and that you found it useful.
