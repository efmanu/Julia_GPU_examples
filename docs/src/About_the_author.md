I am a PhD student studying bioinformatics (computational biology) at the University of Cambridge and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. I am supervised by Professor Anne Ferguson-Smith and Dr Martin Hemberg. I got interested in GPU software development because of its potential to accelerate bioinformatics software. I hope you enjoyed reading this tutorial and that you found it useful.
